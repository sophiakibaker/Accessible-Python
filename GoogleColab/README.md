The files in this directory contain a summary of Google Colab features that may be relevant to dyslexic, neurodivergent and visually impaired users, including:

- Changing fonts, colours and text size in Google Colab
- How to switch to and from dark and light mode in Google Colab
- Setting up Syntax and Type checking in Google Colab 
- Using autocomplete in Google Colab notebooks (this combined with Type checking is the closest equivalent to a spellchecker for Google Colab I have found as of yet)

This resource is aimed at beginners and was created for undergraduate students who had never programmed before.
