This repository contains resources and materials to make Python programming more accessible to people with disabilities and/or neurodivergencies. 

It currently only contains a summary of features that may be relevant to dyslexic, neurodivergent and visually impaired users for Google Colab, including:

- Changing fonts, colours and text size in Google Colab
- How to switch to and from dark and light mode in Google Colab
- Setting up Syntax and Type checking in Google Colab (this is the closest equivalent to a spellchecker for Google Colab I have found as of yet)

But the plan is to keep updating it with further resources as I find them.

Please contact me (sophiakibaker@gmail.com) if you would like any of the files in this repository in an alternative format.
